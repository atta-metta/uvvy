You have full control over devices in My Personal devices, and only partial access control over Third party devices.
Principal is your master identity, it is never exposed or shared to anyone, you contact with peers using one of
the identities you create.
Master identity allows you to control other identities and devices, so it has to be well protected.



Peering:
 ‚òê "Peer" is a remote contact.
   Peer can have a profile, a set of EIDs, various access rights into our cluster(s).
   EIDs correspond to peers' devices and/or identities. Not all peers see the same set of EIDs - some may know more
   than the other. Peer profile serves as a public peer's principal ID, it is not associated with Master Identity
   of this peer in any way. This profile can be exposed or traded by third parties, reducing anonymity.



Peers are concepts in uia::naming namespace:

Peer ::- list of EIDs, profile, list of peers (almost recursively - we don't know their lists of peers)
       ::- with EIDs also list of last known endpoints for those EIDs

These EIDs and endpoints information is also used by the uia::routing layer for DHT.



Urbit:
  Profiles are interesting, you can specify a lot of information about yourself.

  %lord male-identified individual
  %lady female-identified individual
  %punk opaque handle
  %anon totally anonymous
  %home family
  %crew corporation
  %band creative collective
  %fair nonprofit
  %dept government agency
  %holy religious institution

 Also ask for political alignments, profile pic, given name(s), nicknames, family names, CEO, leaders etc.
 Probably look at a Facebook profile? What's relevant there - education, past working places etc.
 You can add this in your profile yourself, but it can also be harvested and filled in by other peers in their instances
 of your profile. The notes they keep and whatever you update never overwrite each other, so it's possible to
 collect information you see relevant.
