Metta Grabber prototype
=======================

### First prototype requirements

* should be possible to add a device to personal device "cluster", thus allowing it to search the entire cluster and modify (optionally) data in the cluster.
* should be possible to remove a device from cluster, there might be no access to this device anymore (e.g. lost phone)
* devices in the cluster always keep track of status for other devices in the cluster and synchronize with them often.
* synchronized objects - some blobs with associated metadata. blob structure is not defined and is not interesting to the synchronization layer. metadata is a key-value store, with fine-grained synchronization.
* search between devices is performed in metadata index, which devices try to synchronize with priority to other objects.
* if found metadata points to a blob absent in local store, system tries to find the blob on other devices and synchronize it.
* for the first version storage area can be limited to devices within the cluster. in general, blobs could be redundantly and securely stored on any nodes across the network.

### Future routing possibilities

* UIP-like routing (EID's + extended DHT based routing through EID space)

### GUI features

* monitor Files folder for stuff to sync.
* metadata assignments - how? extract as much as possible automatically.
* how to perform search? an ESC-interface sounds intriguing

Dependencies
============

* Qt4 at http://qt-project.org/ (QtCore, QtNetwork; QtXml for UPnP; QtGui for demo apps)
* cmake at http://cmake.org/
* boost at http://boost.org/

aptly
 $ apt-get install git cmake clang libboost-test1.50-dev libqt4-dev libssl-dev libasound2-dev

 With these MettaNode also compiles and runs in Raspberry Pi's raspbian.
